# LeanSheets
A simpler spreadsheet.

By Edgar Perez and Shusanta Bhattarai

The mission during the development of LeanSheets centered on providing a simple interface for users to
store and analyze their data. The program also aims to provide flexibility in how the user's data is managed
between different workflows. The *.lean* extension represents a standard text file, which allows LeanSheets
to be cross compatible with correctly parsed *.csv* and *.txt* files. Users also have the option of saving their
work in *.csv* and *.txt* files of their choice. Thank you for choosing LeanSheets as your spreadsheet application.
